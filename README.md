# XR-Swarm-Bridge
XR-Swarm-Bridge enables real-time control of 100+ robots through immersive VR/AR interfaces, powered by GPT-4o for natural language commanding. With sub-200ms latency via WebRTC, operators can seamlessly orchestrate robotic swarms, rewind causal traces, and inject LLM-generated plansâ€”all while maintaining human-in-the-loop safety guarantees.
